Hackathon App

Originally created during the Waterloo Eng. Hacks to have live speech-to-text conversion with real-time text display so that during lectures the hard or hearing, the deaf, (or those who skip lectures) have a better learning experience. It uses cutting-edge voice recognition and machine-learning to have the most accurate speech-to-text conversion using Google speech API. Current features include: Speech-to-text file output, text sharing through emails, 32 different languages, and swear word filtering.

New features coming soon include:
-Quick Summary: which finds and summarizes information from the lecture using key words and uses a summarizing algorithm to summarize the whole lecture to a quick summary easy for the user to read 
-Smart Format: adds formatting features such structuring information into paragraphs, fixes grammatical errors, and allows additional resources such as graphs to be added later on
-Note Share: allows users to share notes and includes the feature of using the Amazon Echo to record the lecture for multiple computers in real-time
